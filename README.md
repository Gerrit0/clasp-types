# clasp-types

A [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) definitions generator for [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) projects, so you can get **autocomplete** and **type checking** for your [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) code.

It works by adding the ```@public``` comment annotation to any global function, class, interface or enum with:

```ts
/**
 * 
 * @public
 */
function 
```

The clasp-types was originally created to build the [BkperApp](https://github.com/bkper/bkper-app) library, with inspirations on the [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) and previous work from [grant](https://github.com/grant/google-apps-script-dts), [motemen](https://github.com/motemen/dts-google-apps-script) and [mtgto](https://github.com/mtgto/dts-google-apps-script-advanced)

> Note: The library must be written in Typescript.
